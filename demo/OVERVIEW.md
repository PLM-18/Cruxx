# Project Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Name
``` c
Forensic Link
```

## ðŸš€ Summary
``` 
Forensic Link is a secure, role-based digital forensics platform that helps teams respond to digital emergencies. It combines strong access control and encryption with gamification elements like achievements, XP, and leaderboards to keep analysts engaged and motivated while managing cases in collaborative workspaces.
```

## âœ¨ Key Features
``` 
 Analytics dashboard for monitoring and detecting potential DDoS attacks on the app
 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) hierarchy for secure, granular access management
 Gamification achievements and XP for investigative actions and case progress
 Collaborative workspaces for analysis and teamwork on cases
 Admin role for managing users and system-wide settings
 Manager role for organizing and managing workspaces
 Analyst role for collaborating on cases and earning achievements through investigation
```

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
``` 
Many existing digital forensics platforms are non-interactive and lack collaborative features, making it difficult for analysts to work together efficiently. These platforms are also vulnerable to DDoS attacks and often do not provide engaging experiences for users. Our motivation was to build a secure, interactive, and collaborative platform that not only protects against threats like DDoS but also supports role-based access, gamification achievements, and real-time teamwork for analysts, managers, and admins.
```

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
``` 
- Implement AES and RSA encryption for enhanced data security
- Integrate HashiCorp Vault for secure storage and management of private keys
- Migrate data storage to PostgreSQL for scalability and reliability
- Add real-time notifications and alerts for suspicious activities
- Expand analytics to cover broader threat detection and reporting
- Develop mobile and desktop clients for wider accessibility
- Integrate advanced machine learning models for automated forensic analysis
- Support multi-language and localization for global teams
